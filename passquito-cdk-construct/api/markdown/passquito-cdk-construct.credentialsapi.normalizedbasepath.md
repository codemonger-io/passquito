Normalized base path.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly normalizedBasePath: string;
```

## Remarks

Surrounding whitespace is trimmed. Leading slashes are reduced to a single slash, and trailing slashes are removed. If there is no leading slash, one is added. It will be an empty string if the base path is root, i.e., "/".
